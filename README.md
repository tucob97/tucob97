## Last project created
**memtuco** is a toy RDBMS written in Rust — not a competitor to PostgreSQL or SQLite, but a learning-focused project packed with meaningful features.

It’s built using only Rust’s standard library, avoiding the complexity of external dependencies. The result is a minimalistic yet surprisingly capable system, intended more for education and exploration than production use.
